</div>

The icons were switched from a SVG based icons to a font based icons system _([Why font based icon?](https://github.com/poseidon-code/supacons/tree/core))_. These icons can be included in your projects just by using the following HTML `<link>` tag :

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://poseidon-code.github.io/supacons/dist/supacons.all.css" />
```

Check [`core`](https://github.com/poseidon-code/supacons/tree/core) branch for more usage guidelines and info about customizing icons.
